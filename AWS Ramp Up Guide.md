    **Model** &rarr; The output of an ML algorithm trained on a data set; used for data prediction.

    **Training** &rarr; The act of creating a model from past data.

    **Testing** &rarr; Measuring the performance of a model on test data.

    **Deploying** &rarr; Integrating a model into a production pipeline.

    </br>

  - History of Amazon and ML:

![History](https://www.algotive.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/00%20Blog/02%20Machine%20Learning/timeline.jpg?width=800&name=timeline.jpg)

**Amazon Flywheel** - How investing in specific key business operations can reinforce other processes and create a positive feedback loop.

**AWS ML Flywheel** - Uses data collected from parts of a business operation, a model to predict future outcomes, and provides ways to continuously improve efficiency.

![ML Flywheel](AWS%20ML%20Flywheel.png)

**Amazon uses ML in the following ways:**

- Product recommendations and promotions.

- Alexa and voice interactions through NLP.

- Ship 1.6M packages per day.

**Amazon AI/ML Services:**

- Amazon Transcribe: Speech to text (Polly's opposite).

- Amazon SageMaker: Think of Jupyter lab on steroids.

</br>

### **How does machine learning work?**

- **AI**: Automate and accelerate tasks performable by humans through natural intelligence. Two types:

  - **Narrow** &rarr; AI imitates human intelligence in a single context.

  - **General** &rarr; AI learns and behaves with intelligence across multiple contexts.

- **ML vs AI: Difference**: AI ingests data and imitates human knowledge vs ML improves model on training data (subset)

![Difference](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bce4071ab1a620db382773e/756e0a76-8544-483b-8757-ad53d2afa7af/Euler+Diag.png)

- **ML vs Traditional Programming**: ML is teaching a computer to recognize patterns by example, rather than programming it with specific rules.

![MLvsProgramming](https://miro.medium.com/max/799/1*t6Myx_4eEwaWP9Vms_kYfg.png)

- **3 Main ML Categories:**

  - **Supervised learning** &rarr; model learns from a data set containing input values and paired output values that you would like to predict. Could be *classification* (spam detection) or *regression* (forecasting demand).

    </br>

  ![Supervised](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K17BRCQTR5hHU-qOthrs9KIQa4DLAWJh5jeXkyn6NZRQfimHnCAadWbw3EaZPZl1bit2IBQPeBv1CZURiyFYkIDPH1Z3Pb0O_qkeS9av7vrEtQLpMLWdtDJ7YNlRki8CoAsY8bmn)

  - **Unsupervised learning** &rarr; training model learns from data without any guidance. The objective is pattern and structure recognition. Could be *clustering* (customer segmentation) or *association* (finding regularities among products).

  ![Unsupervised](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4yFCbNwp0gGdGR5KbquFHA.png)

  - **Reinforcement learning** &rarr; training model learns from its environment by being rewarded for correct moves and punished for incorrect moves. F.ex *autonomous driving*.

  ![Reinforcement](https://miro.medium.com/max/702/1*4u2GtNnMa9xso1WkLh7hVA.png)

</br>

### **What are some potential problems with machine learning?**

- Basically a combination of:

  - Poor Data / Lack of data.

  - Unexplainability (Too complex). Or too simplistic (low accuracy).

  - Take uncertainty (black swan events into account).

</br>

### **Planning a Machine Learning Project**

- Is a machine learning solution appropriate for my problem?

  - Requires 4 main components:

    - **Complex logic** (f.ex recommender).

    - **Requires scalability** (f.ex personalized recommendations to million users).

    - **Requires personalization** (tailored specific to user).

    - **Requires responsiveness** (response in milliseconds to personalization).

  - We dont need to use ML if:

    - Can be solved with traditional algorithms.

    - Does not require adapting to new data.

    - Requires 100% accuracy.

    - Requires full interpretability.

- Is my data ready for machine learning?

  - Types of data:

    - Document

    - Audio

![Lifecycle](https://www.ntconcepts.com/wp-content/uploads/ntc_ml_lifecycle-1.png)

- A typical timeline for ML projects (rough benchmark).

![timeline](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5efeef85594ffa20604a9b76_image2_s.jpg)

</br>

### **What early questions should I ask in deployment?**

- What is the likely computational cost of generating predictions with your model?

- How quickly does your data change?

- How significant are the changes needed to deploy?

- Does the modelâ€™s performance meet the business need?

</br>

### **Building a Machine Learning Ready Organization**

  </br>

### **Machine Learning for Business Challenges**

- Key Takeaways:

  - Defining **scope** of ML problem:

    - Specific business problem we are trying to solve.

    - Current state.

    - What are / what is causing pain points.

    - Impact of the problem.

    - How do we define success.

  - **Input** gathering:

    - Do we have sufficient data?

    - Is there labeled data?

    - How difficult to obtain labeled data?

    - What are the main features?

    - Where is data located?

    - Data quality check?

    - How important is runtime and performance?

- Image **Classification** Problem:

  - We need training data, and groundtruth label.

  - Feature engineering: deciding set of measurements for each instance.

  - Choose classifier model (select the one with higher accuracy on *validation* set and ***good business values***):

    - **SVM** (creates a line which separates the data into classes).

    - **Naive Bayes** (uses Bayes rule together with a strong assumption that the attributes are conditionally independent).

  - Speech to task and automation.

  </br>

### **Machine Learning Terminology and Process**

- **Step 1: Business Problem**

  - What are we trying to solve (see scope,input and output above).

  </br>

- **Step 2: Machine Learning Problem**

  - What model could solve most of our issues.

  - Key Elements:

    - Attributes from dataset &rarr; **Observations**

    - Future Outputs &rarr; **Labels**

    - Used attributes to predict labels &rarr; **features**

  - Framing ML problem:

  - ![sklearnguide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_static/ml_map.png)

- **Step 3: Develop Datasets**

  - Data collection and integration

  - 3 different types:

    - **Structured** (Organized in tabular/databases)

    - **Semi-Structured** (semi - csv, json)

    - **Unstructured** (video, image etc.)

- **Step 4: Data Preparation**

  - Data Cleaning:

    - Could introduce new variable

    - Remove

    - Or Imputation (best guess)

  - Imputation:

    - You can refer here for a comprehensive review of the [**best imputation methods**](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/375794).

    </br>

  - Data Shuffling:

    - We dont want to make predictions just based on order (could lead to bias) - so we shuffle.

  - Test/Val/Train Split:

    - Predict new examples (by holding from our dataset).

    - Train ~ 70% of data.

    - Test ~ 20% of data.

    - Validation ~ 10% of data.

    </br>

  - Cross Validation Techniques:

    - Leave-One-Out (Only use one data point as our test sample, run training with other examples) - Expensive

    - K-Fold (For each fold we train the model and keep track of error).

    </br>

- **Step 5: Data Visualization and Analysis**

  - **Feature** = Attribute in training dataset.

  - **Label** = NOT in training; what we are trying to predict.

  - Types of Visualization for EDA:

    - Statistics

    - Scatterplots

    - Histograms

  - Features and Target Summary:

    - Numerical & Categorical.

    - Usually check distributions / detect outliers through histograms.

    - Check correlation through scatterplots.

   </br>

- **Step 6: Feature Engineering**

  - Converts raw data into a higher representation of the data.

  - F.ex moving from non-linearity to linear models.

    - Numeric value binning in to groups (age, salaries etc.)

    - Quadratic features (combining them together).

    - Non/Linear Feature Transformations (log, product/ratio, tree-path).

    - Domain specific transformation (text/image/web based).

   </br>

- **Step 7: Model Training**

  - Parameters &rarr; tune model to improve performance.

  - **Loss Function** (Calculates how far predictions are from ground truth):

    - **Square** (regression, classification).

    - **Hinge** (classification, best for outliers).

    - **Logistic** (classification, best for skewed data).

  - **Regularization** (Can increase generalization of the model to better fit the data):

    - Prevents overfitting by contraining weights to be too small.

  - **Learning Parameters/Decay Rate** (controls how fast our model learns):

    - Decaying too aggressively (algorithm never reaches the optimum).

    - Decaying too slowly (algorithm bounces around / never converging to an optimum).

</br>

- **Step 8: Model Evaluation**

  - Dont fit training data to obtain maximum accuracy.

    - Overfitting vs Underfitting.

    ![OvervsUnder](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/machine-learning/latest/dg/images/mlconcepts_image5.png)

  - Bias vs Variance:

    - **Bias**: Difference between average model prediction to target values.

    - **Variance**: Variation in prediction of different models.

![BiasvsVariance](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/images/bias_variance/bullseye.png)

- **Evaluation Metrics:**

  - For **regression**:

    - Root Mean Square Error **(RMSE)** - lower is better (use only in test)

    - Mean Absolute Percetage Error **(MAPE)** - lower is better (use only in test)

    - R Squared $(R^2)$ - How much better the is the model compared to picking best constant? **(1 - Model MSE / Variance)**

  - For **classification**:

- Confusion Matrix:

  - ![CF](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian-Bittrich/publication/330174519/figure/fig1/AS:711883078258689@1546737560677/Confusion-matrix-Exemplified-CM-with-the-formulas-of-precision-PR-recall-RE.png)

  - How many data points were classified correctly and incorrectly.

    - ROC Curve - For binary classification prediction.

    - **Precision** (How correct under the positive predictions).

      - F.ex - In search engine - (Precision is quality of viewed / relevance)

    - **Recall** (Fraction of the negatives that were wrongly predicted)

      - F.ex - In search engine - (Recall is completeness of results, and what fraction of relevancy was found)."\n"
   
**True Positives (TP):** The cases in which the model correctly predicted the positive class.
**True Negatives (TN):** The cases in which the model correctly predicted the negative class.
**False Positives (FP):** The cases in which the model incorrectly predicted the positive class (also known as a "Type I error").
**False Negatives (FN):** The cases in which the model incorrectly predicted the negative class (also known as a "Type II error").
![PrecisionvsRecall](precisionvsrecall.png)

  </br>

- **Step 9: Business Goal Evaluation**

  - Do we need data or feature **augmentation** ?

  - Evaluate how model is performing related to business goals:

    - Accuracy of the model.

    - Interpretability.

    - Model generalization on unseen/unknown data.

    - Business success criteria (KPIs).

## **Step 2.1: Learn Data Platform Engineering on AWS**

### **Machine Learning Security**

### a) AWS Security Fundamentals

- Cloud security principles:

  - **Implement a strong identity** foundation (Least privilege / enforce separation of duties).

  - **Enable traceability** (Monitor alerts / audit actions / integrate logs).

  - **Apply security at all layers** (defense-in-depth approach).

  - **Automate security best practices** (code version-controlled templates).

  - **Protect data at rest and in transit** (use encryption / access control).

  - **Enforce the principle of least privilege** (Deny everything, and give access only to needed).

  - **Prepare for security events** (Incident management / Simulations)

- Shared Responsibility model

  - **AWS** is responsible for security **OUT** of the cloud.

  - The *customer* is responsible for security **IN** the cloud.

  -![Shared Responsibility](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/files/a/w/aws_prod1_docebosaas_com/1673427600/uHxSu_RsNM8QdLbhxHxLkA/tincan/842b44ce18500c7e75f3c09fb3a74da4d121de2f/assets/e4_6y4d7cz51Bo0Y_M4k8jdbphutKhqfN.png)
